# An HTML5 Text-Based Story Game
This game is an interactive story-telling game, it's still in development, but it's something
that I'm genuinely excited to work on.

This game utilizes JS, HTML, CSS, and JQuery to deliver a game that is as immersive as a text-based
game can get.

The source code is now outdated, the link is different as well.
